Install notification hooks to the current project's `.claude/` directory.

This adds hooks for:
- Audio/popup notification when Claude is waiting for input
- Audio/popup notification when Claude completes a task

Run the installation script:

```bash
bash ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/cc-plugins/notifications/scripts/install-notifications.sh
```
